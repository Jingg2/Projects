        <p>From Wattpad story to published book to a movie! Watch your favorite coming-of-age camp romance come to life on screen on August 2, 2024! 

After running away from her problems for four years - her inability to run a mile ironically being one of them - Whitney Carmichael knows a fitness camp will kick start some change in her life. 

Little does she expect her high school archenemy will be there desperately trying to make amends. Or that she'll ditch her wallflower status and find herself at the center of a web of toxic friendships and petty lies.

And working out? It's not so bad when her new personal trainer, Axel, is pretty easy on the eyes...and she has everything to lose.</p>
